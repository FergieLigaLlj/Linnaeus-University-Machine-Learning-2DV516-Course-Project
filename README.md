# Linnaeus-University-Machine-Learning-2DV516-Course-Project
Hello everyone!
My name is Fergie, Yishu Yang.

This is my accomplishment of coursework codes for Course 2DV516: Introduction to Machine Learning from Linnaeus University, where I completed my exchange program for one semester in the spring of 2024.
This course aims to provide students with fundamental and advanced statistical machine learning practices, focusing on supervised and unsupervised learning.
It should be acknowledged that all Python codes and Jupyter Notebooks are finished by myself alone, whereas some algorithms may have references online. Anyway, it is my work.
More than half of the accomplishments have desired outcomes. In contrast, the remaining is open-ended and requires us to find suitable real-world data and find optimal solutions out of many high-dimensional learning models with some dimension reduction techniques.

Here is a brief abstract:

A1 (branch master1): K-NN classification and regression from scratch and use scikit-learn

A2 (branch master2): Linear and Polynomial Regression (Multivariate Regression Model), Logistic Regression (Linear and Non-Linear),  Model Selection and Regularization (ROCAnalysis, Backward/Forward/Best-subset Selection)

A3 (branch master3): Supervised learning algorithms: Neural networks (Fashion MNIST, algorithm from scratch), Ensemble methods and Decision Trees (Testing trees, Ensemble of Trees), Support vector machines (flexibility, Various kernels, Implicit versus explicit, One versus all)
* MNIST Dataset is very large, I used the LFS git commit method to push large CSV files.

A4 (branch master4): Unsupervised Learning: Clustering, Data Visualization, Comparison of DR Techniques, Comparison of Clustering Techniques.

In each sub-master branch, there are detailed README.md

Thanks!

By the way, this course is my favourite one at Linnaeus University, and I miss my days in the Library of Linnaeus University working on it.

At all, I miss that small town, Vaxjo.
